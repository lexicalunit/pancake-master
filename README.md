Pancake Master is two separate components: A python notification script which hits the Drafthouse API and looks for any relevant updates, and a dynamic webpage component that hits the same API and uses AJAX to render the information in a web browser.

## Notification Script

Python script that searches for Master Pancake showtimes in Austin. Run it periodically to send out email notifications for newly detected or newly on-sale pancakes. Never miss out on getting tickets again! See requirements.txt for dependencies.

## Dynamic Webpage

Static HTML+AJAX solution which fetches and displays the most up-to-date Master Pancake information. Deploy to a webserver with dependencies pancake.css, jquery, and underscore. [See it live](http://lexicalunit.github.io/pancake-master) on GitHub pages!
